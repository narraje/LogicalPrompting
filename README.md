# LogicalPrompting
Exploring the efficacy of LLMs usage in logical reasoning and computation, with a concentration in ACL2s.

Things to look out for:
-Hallucination
-Dead ends
We will mark down these inconsitency's and mistakes in the LLMs responses throughout all stages. If we see these unfavorable results we will play around with sentiment and perform sentiment analysis. 

Step 1:
Sunday 11/17/24
Hand pick questions from our array of homeworks and choose our subset of LLMs. Begin base testing stage with questions (no prompting). Additionally, base testing for questions will be done individually, so the results of a prior question cannot influence the results of ones following it. Analyze and compare results between LLMs. 

Step 2:
TBD
Testing LLMs with the same set of questions. This time we will feed the LLMs rap (lecture notes). Again, testing with questions will be done individually. We will then analyze and compare results between LLMs and against Step 1 results.

Step 3:
TBD
Testing LLMs with the same set of questions. This time we will feed the LLMs rap and also do all the questions together (have each one build off each other). Analyze and compare results between LLMs and against Step 2 and Step 1  results.

Step 4:
TBD
Testing LLMs with the same questions, but focusing on a subset of equation reasoning and induction proofs. Test multiple different prompt strategies. Initial strategy will just be the ALC2s prompt format. Then improvise professional method and ask the LLMs to do "paper and pencil" proofs. Analyze and compare results. 

Step 5:
TBD
Repeat Step 4 in pseudocode, multiple different langauges? Compare between step 5 and step 4 results. Decide what is best, and if its effective.
