# LogicalPrompting
Exploring the efficacy of LLMs usage in logical reasoning and computation, with a concentration in ACL2s. 


Nico and Harsh

Step 1:
Sunday 11/17/24
Hand pick questions from our array of homeworks and choose our subset of LLMs. Begin base testing stage with questions (no prompting). Additionally, base testing for questions will be done individually, so the results of a prior question cannot influence the results of ones following it. Analyze and compare results between LLMs. 

Step 2:
TBD
Testing LLMs with the same set of questions. This time we will feed the LLMs rap (lecture notes). Again, testing with questions will be done individually. We will then analyze and compare results between LLMs and against Step 1 results.

Step 3:
TBD
Testing LLMs with the same set of questions. This time we will feed the LLMs rap and also do all the questions together (have each one build off each other). Analyze and compare results between LLMs and against Step 2 and Step 1  results.

Step 4:
TBD
Testing LLMs with the same set of questions.
